## Overview

This repository contains data analysis notebooks for the countries of Sierra Leone, Togo, and Benin. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization to gain insights from the datasets related to each country.

### Notebooks:
1. **Sierra Leone Data Analysis**
2. **Togo Data Analysis**
3. **Benin Data Analysis**

## Notebooks

1. **Sierra Leone Data Analysis**
   - This notebook covers the data analysis for Sierra Leone, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and key insights extraction. It includes visualizations that help in understanding the trends and patterns in the data.

2. **Togo Data Analysis**
   - Similar to the Sierra Leone notebook, this notebook analyzes Togo's data. It includes steps for data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations that provide meaningful insights into the dataset.

3. **Benin Data Analysis**
   - The Benin data analysis notebook contains procedures for cleaning the data, performing EDA, and visualizing key trends and findings.

## Setup and Installation

To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Set up the Python environment**:
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment for the project. Run the following commands to set up and activate it:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

4. **Install the required packages**:
   - Install the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file (if available):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Start Jupyter Notebook to access and run the notebooks:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

6. **Open the Notebooks**:
   - Once Jupyter Notebook is launched, open the notebooks for Sierra Leone, Togo, and Benin data analysis to run them interactively.

## Data

The data used in these notebooks is stored in the `data/` directory. Make sure the datasets for Sierra Leone, Togo, and Benin are present in this directory before running the notebooks.

## Results

The analysis results include:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries.
- **EDA**: Descriptive statistics, distributions, correlations, and visualizations for key variables.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of the data trends and patterns to better understand the insights.
